### What is Classification?
**Classification**  is among the most important areas of machine learning, and  **logistic regression**  is one of its basic methods. 

## Classification[](https://realpython.com/logistic-regression-python/#classification "Permanent link")

[Classification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_classification)  is a very important area of  [supervised machine learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supervised_learning). A large number of important machine learning problems fall within this area. There are many classification methods, and logistic regression is one of them.


### What Is Classification?

Supervised machine learning algorithms define models that capture relationships among data.  **Classification**  is an area of supervised machine learning that tries to predict which class or category some entity belongs to, based on its features.

For example, you might analyze the employees of some company and try to establish a dependence on the  **features**  or  **variables**, such as the level of education, number of years in a current position, age, salary, odds for being promoted, and so on. The set of data related to a single employee is one  **observation**. The features or  variables can take one of two forms:

1.  **Independent variables**, also called inputs or predictors, don‚Äôt depend on other features of interest (or at least you assume so for the purpose of the analysis).
2.  **Dependent variables**, also called outputs or responses, depend on the independent variables.

In the above example where you‚Äôre analyzing employees, you might presume the level of education, time in a current position, and age as being mutually independent, and consider them as the inputs. The salary and the odds for promotion could be the outputs that depend on the inputs.

The nature of the dependent variables differentiates regressionand classification problems.  **Regression**  problems have continuous and usually unbounded outputs. An example is when you‚Äôre estimating the salary as a function of experience and education level. On the other hand,  **classification**  problems have discrete and finite outputs called  **classes**  or  **categories**. For example, predicting if an employee is going to be promoted or not (true or false) is a classification problem.

There are two main types of classification problems:

1.  **Binary**  or  **binomial classification:**  exactly two classes to choose between (usually 0 and 1, true and false, or positive and negative)
2.  **Multiclass**  or  **multinomial classification:**  three or more classes of the outputs to choose from

If there‚Äôs only one input variable, then it‚Äôs usually denoted with ùë•. For more than one input, you‚Äôll commonly see the vector notation ùê± = (ùë•‚ÇÅ, ‚Ä¶, ùë•·µ£), where ùëü is the number of the predictors (or independent features). The output variable is often denoted with ùë¶ and takes the values 0 or 1.

### When Do You Need Classification?
You can apply classification in many fields of science and technology. For example, text classification algorithms are used to separate legitimate and spam emails, as well as positive and negative comments. Other examples involve medical applications, biological classification, credit scoring, and more.

Image recognition tasks are often represented as classification problems. For example, you might ask if an image is depicting a human face or not, or if it‚Äôs a mouse or an elephant, or which digit from zero to nine it represents, and so on. 

## Logistic Regression Overview[](https://realpython.com/logistic-regression-python/#logistic-regression-overview "Permanent link")

Logistic regression is a fundamental classification technique. It belongs to the group of  **linear classifiers**  and is somewhat similar to polynomial and  **linear regression**. Logistic regression is fast and relatively uncomplicated, and it‚Äôs convenient for you to interpret the results. Although it‚Äôs essentially a method for binary classification, it can also be applied to multiclass problems.

### Math Prerequisites[](https://realpython.com/logistic-regression-python/#logistic-regression-overview "Permanent link")


You‚Äôll need an understanding of the  sigmoid function and the  natural logarithm function to understand what logistic regression is and how it works.

This image shows the sigmoid function (or S-shaped curve) of some variable ùë•:

The sigmoid function has values very close to either 0 or 1 across most of its domain. This fact makes it suitable for application in classification methods.
