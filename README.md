## Machine_Learning_project
This repository contains detailed **Exploratory Data Analysis** of the datasets (both supervised and unsupervised datasets) with the final objective of devoloping the Machine learning models.
Basically any Jupyter notebook starts with Data Discription, Exploratory Data Analysis, Splitting of Dependent & Independent Variables (if Supervised Learning), Data scaling, Train Test Split followed by devoloping various ML models
